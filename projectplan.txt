Visual: Historical data of a single currency over time
API: https://exchangerate.host/#/docs

-inputs: Start date, end date, frequency of data, currency, OPTIONAL: 'base' currency
- I control all input options via dropdowns


THE PLAN:
-Start by getting data for one option of all of these, and calcuate all the bar heights and labels.
-Then, one at a time, I can build in variable amounts
-Then, figure out what the 'initial' values returned are.
--If time, I can generate the list of currencies from the API
--If time, I can generate the available dates from the API


Step one: data from one place
-move margin from below bars to above bars DONE
-get data from API. stash it somewhere. global variable? DONE
-Change internal bar chart from 5 grid rows, to a single Flexbox
-manipulate data. from API data --> CSS properties. stash variable somewhere.
-DOM manipulation (render function)


step 1.5: accommodate variable number of bars
-maybe create a grid within a grid????
-or maybe this is what flexbox is for?

Step 2: variable amounts
-add fields to margin











-pseudo classes - every other bar a different color or design
-





requirements still to hit:
-bem
-css variables
-js alert
