Visual: Historical data of a single currency over time
API: https://exchangerate.host/#/docs

-inputs: Start date, end date, frequency of data, currency, OPTIONAL: 'base' currency
- I control all input options via dropdowns


THE PLAN:
-Start by getting data for one option of all of these, and calcuate all the bar heights and labels.
-Then, one at a time, I can build in variable amounts
-Then, figure out what the 'initial' values returned are.
--If time, I can generate the list of currencies from the API
--If time, I can generate the available dates from the API


Step one: data from one place
-move margin from below bars to above bars DONE
-get data from API. stash it somewhere. global variable? DONE
-Change internal bar chart from 5 grid rows, to a single Flexbox DONE
-manipulate data. from API data --> CSS properties. stash variable somewhere. DONE
-DOM manipulation (render function) DONE
-ADD Base currency and currency worth to amount

step 1.5: accommodate variable number of bars DONE
-Maybe variable 'base' value (not always zero)

Step 2: variable amounts
-Currency to compare
-Date Range
-Frequency


Step 3: Modify code so render function generates a single time per query
-perhaps Promise is the way to go?








-pseudo classes - every other bar a different color or design

requirements still to hit:
-bem
-css variables
-js alert
